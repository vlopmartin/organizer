# Organizer

Personal task organizer. Displays a list of your tasks and allows you to mark them as complete when they're done.

This is a personal project, so it is made for my personal needs, but everyone is free to use it or modify it!

## Features

* Create new tasks with a name and a description, or edit existing ones
* View a list of all your tasks
* Complete a task by tapping the check mark icon
* Set a due date for a task. The main list will display first the tasks that are due today, or that have no due date
* Set a priority for a task. The main list will sort the tasks by priority
* Set a repeat period for a task. When you mark a task as completed, if it's marked as repeating, it will create a copy of that task for the future
